      'I am Erick Golos, a Tech Lead and full stack developer with strong front-end expertise. With several years of experience in creating websites and interactive applications, I have evolved into a technical leadership role where I guide teams, direct technological choices, and ensure the overall quality of delivered products.<br><br>My specialty remains designing modern, attractive, and high-performance user interfaces using technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and the Vue.js framework (versions 2 and 3). As a Tech Lead, I also focus on defining robust architectures, establishing good development practices, and supporting developers in their skill development.<br><br>What deeply motivates me is the continuous learning dynamic inherent to our profession. Technologies evolve rapidly, and I enjoy taking on the challenges this implies, whether exploring new tools or rethinking existing approaches to gain efficiency.<br><br>Finally, I firmly believe in the power of collective effort. I place great importance on collaboration, communication, and knowledge sharing. As a Tech Lead, I encourage a supportive and stimulating work environment where everyone can express themselves, learn, and contribute to the success of projects.',
